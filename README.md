Orbits is a small orbital mechanics simulation.
Players control a ship orbiting a sun that can accelerate and display its orbital curve.
In Versus mode, two players control two ships simultaneously from one keyboard and can attempt to shoot at one another.

## Creation

The main part of the project will be created within one day to learn the Coffee game engine.
